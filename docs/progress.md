Research & Dataset Selection
We researched publicly available datasets of plant diseases. The chosen datasets were:
Dataset	Reason for Use
vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset:
Base dataset covering multiple crops and disease types. Useful for general plant disease classification.
habibulbasher01644/olive-leaf-image-dataset:
Contains images of olive leaves, including common diseases in Jordan (like Peacock Spot).
serhathoca/zeytin	Additional:
olive leaf images for better representation of olive diseases.
kushagra3204/wheat-plant-diseases:
Focused wheat plant disease dataset to include key crops cultivated in Jordan.
Why classification and not object detection:
Object detection identifies and localizes multiple objects in an image, which is more complex and resource-intensive.
Our goal is to classify images of leaves by disease type, which is simpler and sufficient for early detection and decision-making in agriculture.
Classification allows faster model training and easier integration into mobile/field apps for farmers.
