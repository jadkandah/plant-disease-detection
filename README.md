## Project Goal
To develop an AI-based system that automatically detects plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning techniques.  
The system aims to help farmers quickly identify diseases and take early action to prevent crop loss.

## Objectives
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant diseases.  
- Use a public dataset (e.g., PlantVillage) for training.  
- Create an easy-to-use interface for uploading plant images.  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
- **Name:** PlantVillage Dataset  
- **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)  
- **Classes:** 38 categories of healthy and diseased leaves.  
- **Format:** RGB images.  

## Methodology (Initial Idea)
1. **Image Pre-processing:** resize, normalize, and augment images.  
2. **Model Training:** use CNN architecture (possibly VGG16 or MobileNet).  
3. **Evaluation:** compare accuracy and confusion matrix.  
4. **Deployment (Phase 2):** web or mobile interface for predictions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib  
- MkDocs (for documentation)
